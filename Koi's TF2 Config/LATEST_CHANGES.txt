Koi's Config 3.2 (4/30/2020) changes:

For koi_custom:
- Disabled mvm sentry buster explosion clouds (koi_custom\materials\particle\fluidexplosions\<vtf files>)
- Disabled mvm tank explosion clouds and wooden barrier explosion clouds (koi_custom\particles\mvm.pcf + bigboom.pcf)
- Removed the mvm tank destruction rubble by replacing the rubble model with the broken bottle model
  for no particular reason other than to not show a red "ERROR" (koi_custom\models\bots\boss_bot\boss_tank_part1_destruction.mdl)
- Added ZooL's mvm cash mod which makes cash much more visible by using helpful active/just expired 
  indicator that can be seen through most nearby/close/short walls (koi_custom\particles\mvm.pcf + bigboom.pcf)
- Added sigsegv's robot animation fixes and sentry buster model fixes

For koi_cfg:
- Overhead damage is now in the hud+ui area, since it makes more sense being grouped with the hud commands

Koi's Config 3.2 (4/30/2020) changes:

For koi_custom:
- Disabled mvm sentry buster explosion clouds (koi_custom\materials\particle\fluidexplosions\<vtf files>)
- Disabled mvm tank explosion clouds and wooden barrier explosion clouds (koi_custom\particles\mvm.pcf)

For koi_cfg:
- Overhead damage is now in the hud+ui area, since it makes more sense being grouped with the hud commands

Koi's Config 3.1 changes:

For koi_custom:
- Disabled the large in-game combat help box (i.e. "you are attacking"/"you are defending") by modifying the "viewed.res" file to have seen every default valve map 50 times.
- Disabled the annoying MOTD/News tab on the main menu by removing everything MOTD-related from "mainmenuoverride.res".
- Made a custom default selection of favorite casual maps using "casual_criteria.vdf".
    15 maps are selected by default.
    Attack/Defense:
        Dustbowl, Gravelpit, Junction, Mercenary Park, Steel
    Payload:
        Badwater, Barnblitz, Borneo, Goldrush, Hoodoo, Snowycoast
    Misc:
        2Fort Invasion, Doomsday, Probed, Snowplow

For koi_cfg:
- Lowered vol from .25 to .20
- Changed some binds:
    Toggle viewmodel is now on the backslash key "\" instead of the keypad minus key.
    Jump mode changed from keypad home key to regular home key.
- Fixed the console filter with some clarification on what used to be wrong.
- In the main graphics config, set "mat_mipmaptextures" to 0 and "mat_filtertextures" to 1. This makes weapon textures look far better, and prevents them from re-loading slowly everytime you respawn.
- Renamed "tweaks" to "enhancements"
- Renamed "veteran_quickskipper.cfg" to "tutorial_skip.cfg"
- Added some missing tutorial skipping commands
